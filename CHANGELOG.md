# Changelog

All notable changes to Lintasan Go are documented here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project uses
semantic-ish versioning.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Single self-contained binary.** The SvelteKit dashboard is now compiled to a
  static SPA and embedded into the Go binary via `go:embed`. `lintasan start`
  serves the full UI **and** the API from one executable on `:20180` — no
  separate Node process, no nginx required for a basic deployment.
- `make build` orchestrates the full build (frontend → embed → binary).
- Multi-stage `Dockerfile` (builds frontend + backend) and `docker-compose.yml`
  so `docker compose up --build` produces a single working container.
- Pre-built `lintasan-linux-amd64` binary attached to the release.

### Changed
- Frontend switched from `adapter-node` to `adapter-static` (pure client-rendered
  SPA; the dashboard already ran with `ssr=false` everywhere).
- `authMiddleware` now serves the embedded SPA + static assets publicly (no
  secrets there) while keeping every `/api`, `/v1`, and `/mcp` endpoint gated.
  Guarded by an explicit allowlist (`isPublicUIPath`) with dedicated tests.
- README Quick Start / Installation rewritten to match reality (the old binary
  download URL 404'd and the Docker instructions referenced a compose file that
  didn't build the frontend).

### Notes
- Building from source now requires **Node 20+** in addition to **Go 1.22+** to
  compile the dashboard. `go build` alone still works but yields an API-only
  server (UI reports as unavailable).

## [2.3.7] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Registered 23 RESTful dashboard routes (`DELETE /api/keys/{id}`,
  `PATCH /api/plugins/{id}`, etc) that were never wired into the mux. Go 1.22's
  strict ServeMux made every edit/delete/toggle button silently return 405.
- Three pre-existing no-op stubs now persist: team delete, team member add, and
  webhook create (the form posts `{url, events}` with no `action` field).

## [2.3.6] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- User Management full parity: list rendering (response-shape mismatch), real
  create/delete/role-change, admin password reset, self-service change-password,
  and `must_change_password` now surfaced by `ListUsers`. Added last-admin guards.

## [2.3.5] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Login UX: a wrong password now surfaces "invalid credentials" instead of the
  misleading "Session expired" message.

## [2.3.4] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Unified auth transport (raw `fetch` → `api.*` wrapper) to eliminate a
  split-brain where some requests carried the JWT and others didn't.

## [2.3.3] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- 403 `password_change_required` handling and secret-masking hardening.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- Security & Reliability release: fail-closed auth, bootstrap/active state
  machine, first-run setup redesign.
